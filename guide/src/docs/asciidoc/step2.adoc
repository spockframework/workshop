= Step 2

In step 2 we'll teach you some of the more advanced features of Spock.
Including interaction based testing (mocking and stubbing) and the integration with Spring.

The code for this step can be found in the `step2` folder.

[[_step2_scenario]]
== Scenario
You have been given a ToDo microservice to maintain.
The team of consultants that developed it decided to skip the tests since the deadline was very ambitious,
and they didn't have to maintain it afterwards.

.Classes
[plantuml, classes, format=svg]
....
class Task {
    -id:String
    -title:String
    -body:String
    -dueDate:LocalDate
    -done:Boolean

    +isOverdue():boolean
}

class TaskController {
    -taskService:TaskService
    getTask(id:String)
    getTasksToDo():List<Task>
    getTasksOverdue():List<Task>
    getTasksDueToday():List<Task>
    postTask(task:Task):ResponseEntity<Task>
    postPlainTask(task:String):ResponseEntity<Task>
    patchTask(task:Task):ResponseEntity<Task>
    delete(id:String):ResponseEntity<Void>
}

class TaskService {
    -taskRepository:TaskRepository
    findTasksToDo():List<Task>
    findTasksOverdue():List<Task>
    findTasksDueToday():List<Task>
    saveTask(task:Task):Task
    findTask(id:String):Optional<Task>
    updateTask(id:String, updateTask):Optional<Task>
    deleteTask(id:String)
    createTaskFromPlainText(task:String):Task
}

interface TaskRepository {
    findAllByDoneIsFalseAndDueDateBefore(date:LocalDate):List<Task>
    findAllByDoneIsFalseAndDueDate(date:LocalDate):List<Task>
    save(task:Task):Task
    findById(id:String):Optional<Task>
}

TaskController --* TaskService
TaskService --* TaskRepository
....

=== ToDo Features

The The ToDo microservice offers a standard CRUD interface for managing tasks.

==== Plaintext
As an alternative to creating a `Task` via json, a task can also be created using plain text.
The text is parsed as follows.

The `title` is separated from the `description` with two newlines.
If there are no two newlines in the `text`, then the whole `text` is treated as `description`.

.Example Task 1
----
Title text

Description text
lorem ipsum...
----

.Example Task 2
----
Description text
lorem ipsum...
----

===== At-Date Pattern
The ToDo microservice offers the convenience feature to define the `dueDate` inline via an `@`-Pattern.
Examples are:

- `Do dishes @tomorrow`
- `@nextMonth Pay rent`
- `Call John on @2020-03-12 and congratulate him.`

<<at-regex-diagram>> shows a diagram of the used regex and which patterns should be possible.

There may only be zero or one `@`-Date pattern in a task.

- `nextWeek` is synonymous with `nextMonday`
- `nextMonth` is the first day of the month

== Layers of Tests

The test pyramid <<test-pyramid>> differentiates between three layers of tests: unit-tests, service tests, and ui tests.
There are different names for the service tests and ui tests layers, depending on what kind of application your are developing.
For this scenario we will use unit-test and integration test, mostly because maven has only these two categories by default.

[quote, The Practical Test Pyramid]
____
Still, due to its simplicity the essence of the test pyramid serves as a good rule of thumb when it comes to establishing your own test suite.
Your best bet is to remember two things from Cohn's original test pyramid:

1. Write tests with different granularity
2. The more high-level you get the fewer tests you should have

Stick to the pyramid shape to come up with a healthy, fast and maintainable test suite:
Write lots of small and fast unit tests.
Write some more coarse-grained tests and very few high-level tests that test your application from end to end.

== Unit Tests


[quote, The Practical Test Pyramid]
____
What's a Unit?

If you ask three different people what "unit" means in the context of unit tests, you'll probably receive four different, slightly nuanced answers.
To a certain extent it's a matter of your own definition and it's okay to have no canonical answer.

If you're working in a functional language a unit will most likely be a single function.
Your unit tests will call a function with different parameters and ensure that it returns the expected values.
In an object-oriented language a unit can range from a single method to an entire class.
____

=== Objectives
* [ ] Write unit tests for the `TaskController` and `TaskService`, isolate them via the use of `Mock`/`Stub` <<spock-interact>> where appropriate.

== Integration Tests

Integration Tests have many flavors, Spring Boot provides full application tests with `@SpringBootTest`,
it also allows to test the different layers (controller, service, database) with more targeted tests.
Spring calls these slices <<sb-test-slices>> and provides a variety of predefined annotations, for this workshop we will use:

* `@DataJpaTest`
* `@WebMvcTest`
* `@SpringBootTest` + `@AutoConfigureRestDocs`


Spock provides a `spock-spring` module for Spring integration, don't forget to add this in your projects.


=== Objectives
* [ ] Write a `@DataJpaTest` for the `TaskRepository` that tests all the custom queries.
* [ ] Write a `@WebMvcTest` for `TaskController` and use `@SpringBean`<<spock-spring-bean>> to replace the `TaskService` with a Mock.
* [ ] Write a `@SpringBootTest` with `@AutoConfigureRestDocs` <<sb-rest-docs>> to produce a validated documentation for the rest service.
  It is ok, to only write the tests and forgo any more textual description for this workshop.
